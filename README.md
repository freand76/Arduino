# Arduino

Some Arduino projects

NexaTx:
Control Nexa tools using Arduino and a 433MHz transmitter

NexaRx:
Receive Nexa remote using Arduino and a 433MHz receiver

AmpControl:
Turn on amplifier when audio is detected on auxhiliary input to Amplifier
Auxhiliary input is connected to arduino ADC input
When ADC is sampling "high-level" signals the Arduino acts as a Nexa remote
and turning on the Nexa wall plug (where the amplifier is plugged in)
